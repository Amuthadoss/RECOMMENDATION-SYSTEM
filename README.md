TASK : 4.RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
This project involves building a Recommendation System using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques. The system is designed to suggest relevant items (such as products, movies, or content) to users based on their preferences or interactions. It utilizes popular algorithms such as user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, as well as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization. The implementation is done using Python, with the help of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Surprise. A Jupyter Notebook is provided that includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction generation, and evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and precision-recall. This task offers practical experience in building intelligent systems that enhance user personalization in real-world applications.
